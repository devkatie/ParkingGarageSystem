# ParkingGarageSystem
CSE 248 Final Project


This was the Final Project for SCCC's CSE 248. It is meant to mimic a typical parking garage, much like the ones found in New York City. I decided to take my own creative liberties and made it game-like, with pop-y colors and the ability to click on any given Parking Spot and see the information about the Vehicle in the requested spot.

As I am not perfect, this project was submitted with bugs. I was able to fulfil most of the requirements, which were: UML Diagrams (Use case diagram, class diagram); A burndown chart; GitHub usage; Implementation using built-in Java Data Structures or database (Partial); a Javadoc; Junit test cases.

The 248 class offered a broad range of topics to learn from, and I believe I have taken advantage of most of the principles and topics taught. I look forward to tweaking this project further, and even putting it on the Google Play Store as a small minigame of sorts!
